### Test case Prompt

```
Given a question, you need to write several sets of test cases for checking the correctness of the code implementation about the functionality of the given question. Please do not duplicate the Example IO given in the question. You are required to generate at least five sets of test cases that comprehensively validate the implementation's functionality under various conditions, including but not limited to boundary test cases, functional correctness test cases, etc. The elements in each test case can only consist of two parts named caseIn and caseOut, please enclose caseIn part with an extra '[' and ']'. Please also annotate each test case with detailed comments.Again all you have to do and you can do is  return me  only an array called test_cases consisting of caseIn and caseOut two parts.
Here is an example: 

# Problem:
"""
Given a list l, return median of elements in the list. 
>>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
3
>>> median([-7, 4, 6, 100, 10, 20])
15.0
"""

# Test case:
test_cases = [
        ([[-10,4,6,1000,10,20]],[8.0]),
    ]

Now, please provide the test cases for the following problem. Please do not duplicate the Example I0 given in the question.

# Problem:
def by_length(arr):
    """
    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".

    For example:
      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   
            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] 
            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
      return ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
    
      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
      return []
    
      If the array has any strange number ignore it:
      arr = [1, -1 , 55] 
            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]
            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]
      return = ['One']
    """

# Test case:

### Specification Prompt

```
I want you to act as a python programmer. Given a problem, you need to generate two specification functions: preconditions(caseIn), which checks whether the input (caseIn) satisfies certain constraints about the requeriement, and postconditions(caseIn, caseOut) checks the functional relationships between the test inputs (caseIn) and outputs (caseOut) to ensure compliance with the requirements. Please thoroughly assess the correctness of the test cases (caseIn and caseOut) from various perspectives, including but not limited to formal correctness, functional correctness, logical correctness, etc. In the event that an error is encountered during the evaluation, please print the corresponding test case along with a specific error message. Please also generate as many detailed comments as possible.
Here is an example:

# Problem:
"""
Given a list l, return median of elements in the list. 
>>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
3
>>> median([-7, 4, 6, 100, 10, 20])
15.0
"""

# Specification:
def preconditions(l):
    assert isinstance(l, list), "Input is not a list."
    assert all([isinstance(i, (int, float)) for i in l]), "There are elements in input that are not of type int or float."
def postconditions(l, output):
    assert isinstance(output, (int, float)), "There are elements in output that are not of type int or float."
    num_greater = sum([1 for i in l if i >= output])
    num_less = sum([1 for i in l if i <= output])
    assert num_greater == num_less, "Counts of elements greater than or equal to 'output' and less than or equal to 'output' are not equal."

Now, please provide the specifications for the following problem. Your output should only include two functions: "preconditions(caseIn)" and "postconditions(caseIn, caseOut)". You do not need to generate test cases. Only provide the code.

def by_length(arr):
    """

    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from

            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
      return ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
    
      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
