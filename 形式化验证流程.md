# 形式化验证流程

### 1. 给定题目

```python

def pluck(arr):
    """
    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
        * 0 <= node.value
    """

```

### 2.LLM生成代码（可能含有幻觉）

```python
def pluck(arr):
    if not arr:
		return []

	min_even = arr[0]
	min_index = 0
	for i in range(1, len(arr), 2):
		if arr[i] % 2 == 0 and arr[i] < min_even:
			min_even = arr[i]
			min_index = i
	if min_even == arr[0]:
		return [min_even, min_index]
	else:
		return arr[i:i+2*min_even]

```

### 3.LLM生成Specification

```python
# Specification for preconditions
def preconditions(arr):
    """
    Checks preconditions for the pluck function.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): An array representing a branch of a tree.

    Raises:
    AssertionError: If the input is not a list.
    AssertionError: If the list is empty.
    AssertionError: If any element of the list is not a non-negative integer.
    """
    assert isinstance(arr, list), "Input is not a list."
    assert arr, "Input list is empty."
    assert all(isinstance(node, int) and node >= 0 for node in arr), "Elements in the input list are not non-negative integers."

# Specification for postconditions
def postconditions(arr, output):
    """
    Checks postconditions for the pluck function.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): An array representing a branch of a tree.
    output (list): The output list containing the plucked node and its index.

    Raises:
    AssertionError: If the output is not a list.
    AssertionError: If the length of the output list is not 2.
    AssertionError: If the first element of the output list is not a non-negative integer.
    AssertionError: If the second element of the output list is not an integer.
    AssertionError: If the second element of the output list is not a valid index within the input list.
    AssertionError: If the plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
    """
    assert isinstance(output, list), "Output is not a list."
    assert len(output) == 2, "Output list length is not 2."
    assert isinstance(output[0], int) and output[0] >= 0, "First element of the output list is not a non-negative integer."
    assert isinstance(output[1], int), "Second element of the output list is not an integer."
    assert 0 <= output[1] < len(arr), "Index in the output list is out of range."
    smallest_value = min((node, index) for index, node in enumerate(arr) if node % 2 == 0)
    assert output == smallest_value, "The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement."

```

### 4.LLM生成Testcase

```python
# Test cases for pluck function

test_cases = [
    # Test case where there's an even value in the array
    ([[-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]], [4, 1]),
    
    # Test case where all values are odd
    ([[1, 3, 5, 7]], []),
    
    # Test case where the array is empty
    ([[]], []),
    
    # Test case where there are multiple even values but different indices
    ([[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]], [0, 1]),
    
    # Test case where all values are zero
    ([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], [0, 0]),
    
    # Test case where the array contains only one element
    ([[8]], [8, 0]),
    
    # Test case where there are multiple even values with the same index
    ([[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]], [2, 0]),
    
    # Test case where there are multiple even values with different indices
    ([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [4, 1]),
    
    # Test case where there's a mix of even and odd values
    ([[1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 2, 6]], [2, 5])
]

```

### 5.example_IO检查Specification正确性

用test_specification.py检查one_data.jsonl,得到结果

```
Test case ([[4, 2, 3]], [2, 1]): The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
Test case ([[1, 2, 3]], [2, 1]): The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
Test case ([[]], []): Input list is empty.
Filtered Test Cases:
[]
Filtering Rate: 0.00%
```

说明Specification有问题，返回给llm重新生成：

**prompt**

```
I have tested your Specification using example_IO to ensure that it is correct, if your Specification is correct, there should be no errors reported and the filtering rate should be 100%. Please modify your Specification according to the following error message:
# Error Message：
Test case ([[4, 2, 3]], [2, 1]): The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
Test case ([[1, 2, 3]], [2, 1]): The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
Test case ([[]], []): Input list is empty.
Filtered Test Cases:
[]
Filtering Rate: 0.00%
```

经过修改，llm的结果为：

```python
# Specification for preconditions
def preconditions(arr):
    """
    Checks preconditions for the pluck function.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): An array representing a branch of a tree.

    Raises:
    AssertionError: If the input is not a list.
    AssertionError: If any element of the list is not a non-negative integer.
    """
    assert isinstance(arr, list), "Input is not a list."
    assert all(isinstance(node, int) and node >= 0 for node in arr), "Elements in the input list are not non-negative integers."

# Specification for postconditions
def postconditions(arr, output):
    """
    Checks postconditions for the pluck function.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): An array representing a branch of a tree.
    output (list): The output list containing the plucked node and its index.

    Raises:
    AssertionError: If the output is not a list.
    AssertionError: If the length of the output list is not 2.
    AssertionError: If the first element of the output list is not a non-negative integer.
    AssertionError: If the second element of the output list is not an integer.
    AssertionError: If the second element of the output list is not a valid index within the input list.
    """
    assert isinstance(output, list), "Output is not a list."
    assert len(output) == 2, "Output list length is not 2."
    assert isinstance(output[0], int) and output[0] >= 0, "First element of the output list is not a non-negative integer."
    assert isinstance(output[1], int), "Second element of the output list is not an integer."
    assert 0 <= output[1] < len(arr), "Index in the output list is out of range."
    if output:
        assert arr[output[1]] == output[0] and output[0] % 2 == 0, "The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement."

```

运行test_specification，得到结果：

```
Test case ([[]], []): Output list length is not 2.
Filtered Test Cases:
[([[4, 2, 3]], [2, 1]), ([[1, 2, 3]], [2, 1])]
Filtering Rate: 66.67%
```

表明有一定的修改效果，我们可以重复该步骤，再次迭代发现始终是这个结果，这个Specification仍存在一定错误，但llm根据error log无法继续修改了。

### 6.过滤生成的testcase

接着我们用这个Specification对生成的Test case进行测试，用test_test_case.py测试：

```
Test case ([[-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]], [4, 1]): Elements in the input list are not non-negative integers.
Test case ([[1, 3, 5, 7]], []): Output list length is not 2.
Test case ([[]], []): Output list length is not 2.
Filtered Test Cases:
[([[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]], [0, 1]), ([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], [0, 0]), ([[8]], [8, 0]), ([[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]], [2, 0]), ([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [4, 1]), ([[1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 2, 6]], [2, 5])]
Filtering Rate: 66.67%
```

但这里([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [4, 1])这个例子是错误的

### 7.用testcase对幻觉代码进行测试

采用过滤后的test_case对llm生成代码进行测试，得到结果（这里的output是运行幻觉代码得到的）：

```
fail_cases with your output:
[([[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]], []), ([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [8, 2]), ([[1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 2, 6]], [1, 0])]
fail_cases with right answer:
[([[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]], [0, 1]), ([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [4, 1]), ([[1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 2, 6]], [2, 5])]
fail_rate:
50.00%
```

### 8.得到错误输出的error message

将这个fail_cases with your output给specification从而得到error message：

```
Test case ([[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]], []): Output list length is not 2.
Test case ([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [8, 2]): The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
Test case ([[1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 2, 6]], [1, 0]): The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
Filtered Test Cases:
[]
Filtering Rate: 0.00%
```

### 9.返回给llm进行优化

接着把这两部分信息返回给llm进行优化生成的代码：

prompt：

```
I use some Test cases to test your generated program, some of the output error cases and the corresponding error message are as follows, please modify your generated code according to this information:
fail_cases with your output:
[([[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]], []), ([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [8, 2]), ([[1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 2, 6]], [1, 0])]
fail_cases with right answer:
[([[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]], [0, 1]), ([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [4, 1]), ([[1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 2, 6]], [2, 5])]
# Error message:
Test case ([[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]], []): Output list length is not 2.
Test case ([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [8, 2]): The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
Test case ([[1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 2, 6]], [1, 0]): The plucked node does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
```

结果：

```
fail_cases with your output:
[([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [2, 4])]
fail_cases with right answer:
[([[10, 4, 6, 8, 2]], [4, 1])]
fail_rate:
16.67%
```

表明失败率有所下降，并且失败的还是一个错误的testcase

但是问题是这份幻觉代码不一定是gpt生成的，似乎gpt本身就有解决这个问题的能力
